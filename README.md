# Country-Level Analysis of Pro-Social Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing survey data collected during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic to understand country-level differences in predictors of pro-social behaviors. The focus is on identifying key attributes that contribute to participants' willingness to engage in actions that reduce the spread of the virus.

### Data Description
1. **Descriptive Analysis and Pre-processing:**
   - Examined overall data dimensions, data types, numerical attribute distributions, and non-numerical attributes.
   - Addressed missing values and performed relevant pre-processing for subsequent analysis.

### Country Comparison
2. **Focus Country vs All Other Countries:**
   - Chose Russia as the focus country. 
   - Analyzed how participant responses in Russia differ from those in other countries.
   - Evaluated the predictive power of participant responses for pro-social attitudes in Russia.
   - Compared attributes that serve as the strongest predictors for Russia with other countries.

### Cluster Analysis
3. **Russia vs Cluster of Similar Countries:**
   - Identified a cluster of similar countries based on social, economic, health, or political indicators.
   - Conducted clustering analysis, detailing indicators.
   - Assessed how well participant responses predict pro-social attitudes in the cluster and identified the strongest predictors.
   - Compared results with the analysis of all other countries.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into the predictors of pro-social behaviors during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, offering a nuanced understanding of country-level variations.
